                    <h2>What is a PUC Case?</h2>
                    <p>A PUC case occurs when a customer decides to take legal action against the company or anything related to publicly damaging the company's reputation through social media, legal means, or communication media.</p>
                    <p>PUC also stands for Public Utility Commission of Texas. A complaint filed with this commission can be particularly damaging to the company.</p>
